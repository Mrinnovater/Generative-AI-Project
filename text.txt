What is Neural Style Transfer?

Blending style from one image into another





How does NST work?
A pre-trained CNN with added loss functions to transfer style





What are CNNs?
Deep learning model used primarily for image analysis and processing. They use convolutional layers to scan and filter input data

What does NST need as input?
A Content Image
A Style Image
Output is:
An Generated NST Image











Process:
• Detecting Content
• Capturing Style
• Mixing Content and Style








What networks does NST need?
A pre-trained feature extractor
A style network.
